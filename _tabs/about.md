Hello! I am the "infamous" DonutMaster, a middle school student who is passionate about ethical hacking and competitive programming. If you have joined the TryHackMe discord server, I am almost 99% sure you know me as DonutMaster (or DonutMustard) if you are pretty active. Explore the walkthroughs I have created for challenges and solutions for competitive programming problems.
