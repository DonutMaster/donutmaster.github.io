## Adding IP to /etc/hosts

We can add this line:
```
10.10.11.86 soulmate.htb
```
into our /etc/hosts.

## Rustscan

Let's use Rustscan/Nmap to check the ports on the SoulMate machine.

```terminal
donutmaster@ubuntu:~/Desktop$ rustscan -a 10.10.11.86 -- -A
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |
`-' `-'`-----'`----'  `-'  `----'  `---' `-'  `-'`-' `-'
