## Adding IP to /etc/hosts

Add your machine IP into your /etc/hosts:
```
10.10.11.79 era.htb
```

## Rustscan

Let's use Rustscan/Nmap to check the ports on the Era machine.

```terminal
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/HTB/Era]
└─$ rustscan -a era.htb -- -A
.----. .-. .-. .----..---.  .----. .---.   .--.  .-. .-.
| {}  }| { } |{ {__ {_   _}{ {__  /  ___} / {} \ |  `| |
| .-. \| {_} |.-._} } | |  .-._} }\     }/  /\  \| |\  |

Nmap? More like slowmap.🐢

[~] The config file is expected to be at "/home/kali/.rustscan.toml"
[!] File limit is lower than default batch size. Consider upping with --ulimit. May cause harm to sensitive servers
[!] Your file limit is very small, which negatively impacts RustScan's speed. Use the Docker image, or up the Ulimit with '--ulimit 5000'.
