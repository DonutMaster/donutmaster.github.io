Welcome to the DonutMaster's Blog! You can find solutions to hacking challenges and competitive programming problems! Check out my [about me](https://donutmaster.github.io/about-me) to learn more!

# How this Blog was made

Theme: [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

Comments: [Giscus](https://giscus.app)

# What this Blog is about
So, what are you gonna see on this blog?

A lot of the posts I will create/created are either walkthroughs on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) (THM) or [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/) (HTB) challenges and solutions of competitive programming/coding problems I have solved (usually on large competitions, [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/), [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), etc.)

# Contact me
If there is a specific TryHackMe room (not HackTheBox, not yet anyway) or a competitive programming problem I should write a writeup/solution for it, [email](mailto:DonutMaster1337@proton.me) me the room or problem. I will see if I can solve it.

If you want to contact me for anything but hacking/coding, I will ignore you forever. The only topics I will allow is hacking, coding, possibly science, maybe math, and about my blog.

If you are either Slavetomints, DenialandError, DKob, Ashlynn, Haz_0x, darkfly, Jabba, Toaster, skittles, bleu, Timo, or 0day (Ryan) from THM discord server (whom I have talked to before), I give you guys specific permission to talk to me about almost anything.
