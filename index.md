Welcome to the DonutMaster Blog! You can find solutions to hacking challenges and competitive programming problems! You will also see some tutorials on data structures, algorithms, and math! Check out my [about me](https://donutmaster.github.io/about-me) to learn more!

# How this Blog was made

Theme: [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

# What this Blog is about
So, what are you gonna see on this blog?

A lot of the posts I will create/created are either walkthroughs on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) (THM) or [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/) (HTB) challenges and solutions of competitive programming/coding problems I have solved (usually on large competitions, [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/), [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)). Some posts will be about the algorithms and data structures for competitive programming.

I plan on writing posts in the future about my Artificial Intelligence projects written in Pytorch!

# Contact me
If there is a specific TryHackMe room (not HackTheBox, not yet anyway), a competitive programming problem I should write a writeup/solution for, or a DSA topic I should write a tutorial about, [email](mailto:DonutMaster1337@proton.me) me the room, problem, or DSA topic.

If you want to contact me for anything but hacking/coding, I will ignore you forever. The only topics I will allow is hacking, coding, possibly science, maybe math, and about my blog.
